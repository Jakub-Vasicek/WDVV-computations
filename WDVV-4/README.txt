The programs contained in this folder sole the problem of finding a 
third-order local Hamiltonian operator for the second Dubrovin's normal form.

 1) w6_dubrovin_eta2.red
 -in this file I generate the WDVV system for eta diagonal

 2) w6_dubrovin_eta2_res.red
 -this file contains the WDVV system as well as the hydrodynamic-type one

 3) w6_ham1_dubrovin_eta2.red  
 -computing the third-order operator

 4) w6_ham1_dubrovin_eta2_res.red
 -the operator is stored here
