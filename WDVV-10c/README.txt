In this folder there are the programms, as well as their results, regarding the
computation of the third-order Hamiltonian operator for WDVV equation in N=5
for Dubrovin's second normal form. The files contain the following:

 1) w10_hydro_system_gen.red
 -file for generating the WDVV system

 2) w10_eta2_eq.red
 -this file contains the WDVV system as well as the hydrodynamic-type one

 3) Jets.s
 -file containing the Maple extension for calculus in jet spaces

 4) w10_eta2.mw
 -main file for the computation of the operator in Maple worksheet

 5) w10_eta2.txt
 -only the plain text without output from the previous file

 6) w10_eta2_result.txt
 -the metric of the operator in a "rough" form

 7) w10_eta2_result_simplified.txt
 -pretty-printed the above matrix

Note: Files are set up in a way that the computation can be started right away.
However, the computation had to be simplified. It is practically impossible to 
solve all 2100 equations so first 60 were taken only and the solution was 
obtained and checked porpperly. Still the computation demands a huge amount of
resources so please consider using a very powerful machine or even a 
supercomputer.
