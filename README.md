In the above directories there are computer algebra programs that find
Hamiltonian operators for WDVV equations and check their compatibility. The
calculations are done for WDVV equations with N=3, N=4, N=5. There are also
separate README files with more specific information in each of those 
directories.

The above calculations are discussed in the paper by J. Vasicek and R. Vitolo:
"WDVV equations and invariant bi-Hamiltonian formalism", to appear in arXiv.org
(2021).
