 In the above directories there are examples of a computational procedure to 
obtain one or a couple of compatible Hamiltonian operators for WDVV equations.
 In particular, there is one example (executed in REDUCE) for finding a pair of
compatible operators for one of Dubrovin's normal forms in dimension N=3 and 
example for finding a third-order local operator in dimension N=5 which is 
implemented in Maple amongst others. There are also separate README files with 
more specific information in each of those directories.
